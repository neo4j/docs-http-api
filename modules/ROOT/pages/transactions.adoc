= Run transactions

Use transactions to group together related queries which work together to achieve a single logical database operation.
As Neo4j is <<ACID>> compliant, queries within a <<transaction>> will either be executed as a whole or not at all: you cannot get a part of the transaction succeed and another fail.

[NOTE]
--
Cypher queries with link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/current/clauses/call-subquery/#subquery-call-in-transactions[`CALL {} IN TRANSACTIONS`] can not be executed in explicit transactions.
Submit those queries with xref:query.adoc[implicit transactions] instead.

== Create a transaction

To open a new (explicit) transaction, submit a `POST` request to the following endpoint:

----
http://<host>:<port>/db/<databaseName>/tx
----

The body of the request may either:

- contain a `statements` object consisting of a list of statements to execute (example below)
- contain a `statements` object consisting of an empty list
- be entirely empty.

The server will respond with the location of the new transaction.

== Execute queries

Once a transaction is open, you can submit queries to it by sending more `POST` requests to the following endpoint:

----
http://<host>:<port>/db/<databaseName>/tx/<transactionID>
----

You can find the transaction ID under the `commit` key of your first request result.

== Execute multiple queries

To reduce the number of requests and network overhead, you can include multiple statements within a single request.
The server runs them in sequence, but separate from each other, so a statement cannot reference a variable defined in another statement.
The response contains the result of each statement, in order.

  "transaction": {

  }
}

== Transaction expiration and keep alive

Transactions expire automatically after a period of inactivity, after which they are rolled back.
By default the timeout is 30 seconds, but you can set a different value in the server configuration (link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/configuration/configuration-settings#config_server.http.transaction_idle_timeout[`server.http.transaction_idle_timeout`]).

The transaction expiration time is reported in each response, under the `transaction` key.
To keep a transaction alive without submitting new queries, you can submit an empty statement list to the transaction URI.

Attempting to submit queries to an expired transaction results in an error:

[source, JSON]
----
{
  "results": [],
  "errors": [ {
    "code": "Neo.ClientError.Transaction.TransactionNotFound",
    "message": "Unrecognized transaction id. Transaction may have timed out and been rolled back."
  } ]
}
----

[TIP]
--
If a response does not contain the `transaction` key, the corresponding transaction has been closed.
This usually happens after an error is raised.
--


== Commit a transaction

To commit a transaction, send a `POST` request to the following endpoint:

----
http://<host>:<port>/db/<databaseName>/tx/<transactionID>/commit
----

Committing a transaction results in its changes becoming permanent on the database.

The request may optionally include a final bunch of queries, which will be executed before closing the transaction.


== Rollback a transaction

To rollback a transaction, submit a `DELETE` request to the following endpoint:

----
http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/<transactionID>
----

When a transaction is rolled back, the status of the database gets restored to before the transaction was opened.
All the changes your queries would make to the database are thus discarded.

== Authentication failure on open transactions

An authentication error (`Neo.ClientError.Security.Unauthorized`) in a request to an open transaction results in a rollback.
The transaction remains open though.
