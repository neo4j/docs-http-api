:description: Introduction to the Neo4j HTTP API.

[[http-api-introduction]]
= Introduction

[WARNING]
====
The HTTP API is currently not available on link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/aura[Neo4j Aura].
====

The Neo4j transactional HTTP endpoint allows you to execute a series of Cypher statements within the scope of a transaction.
The transaction may be kept open across multiple HTTP requests, until the client chooses to commit or roll back.
Each HTTP request can include a list of statements, and for convenience you can include statements along with a request to begin or commit a transaction.

The server guards against orphaned transactions by using a timeout.
If there are no requests for a given transaction within the timeout period, the server will roll it back.
You can configure the timeout in the server configuration, by setting link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/{page-version}/configuration/configuration-settings#config_dbms.rest.transaction.idle_timeout[`dbms.rest.transaction.idle_timeout`] to the number of seconds before timeout.
The default timeout is `60` seconds.

Responses from the HTTP API can be transmitted as JSON streams, resulting in better performance and lower memory overhead on the server side.
To use streaming, supply the header `X-Stream: true` with each request.

[NOTE]
====
* Literal line breaks are not allowed inside Cypher statements.
* Cypher queries with `USING PERIODIC COMMIT` (see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/query-tuning/using#query-using-periodic-commit-hint[Cypher Manual -> `PERIODIC COMMIT` query hint]) may only be executed when creating a new transaction and immediately committing it with a single HTTP request (see xref::/actions/begin-and-commit-a-transaction-in-one-request.adoc[Begin and commit a transaction in one request] for how to do that).
* When a request fails the transaction will be rolled back.
By checking the result for the presence/absence of the `transaction` key you can figure out if the transaction is still open.

[TIP]
====
In order to speed up queries in repeated scenarios, try not to use literals but replace them with parameters wherever possible.
This will let the server cache query plans.
See link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/syntax/parameters#cypher-parameters[Cypher Manual -> Parameters] for more information.
