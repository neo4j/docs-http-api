:description: Configuring HTTP Transactions.

= Transaction Configuration

For any transaction-initiating request (such as `/tx` or `tx/commit`), you can provide configuration options that apply for the duration of the whole transaction.

== Access Mode

To ensure efficient load balancing across a cluster, it is important to label transactions that only contain `READ` statements with a `READ` access mode.

This can be done by adding an `access-mode` header to the request, with a value of `READ`.

This feature was introduced in Neo4j version 4.4.4.

[WARNING]
====
If an `access-mode` configuration has *not* been provided, the default value is `WRITE`.

However, if you have clusters with link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/clustering/internals/#clustering-routing[Server-side routing] disabled, the default value is `READ`.
