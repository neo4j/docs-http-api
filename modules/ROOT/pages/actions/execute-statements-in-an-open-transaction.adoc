:description: Run queries in a transaction.

= Run queries inside a transaction

Once you have an open transaction by calling `db/\{name}/tx`, you can run additional statements that form part of your transaction by calling the newly created transaction endpoint.
The endpoint will be in the form `db/\{name}/tx/\{txid}`, where `txid` is provided in the response of the initial call to begin the transaction.
