:description: This is the manual for the HTTP API, Neo4j version {neo4j-version}.

= Introduction

[WARNING]
====
The HTTP API is currently not available on link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/aura[Neo4j Aura].
====

The Neo4j HTTP API allows you to execute a series of Cypher statements against a Neo4j server through HTTP requests.

To execute queries, you may use either:

- xref:query.adoc[implicit transactions] -- you just submit queries, the API takes care of the transaction handling for you,
- xref:transactions.adoc[explicit transactions] -- you control the lifecycle of the transaction (open, commit, rollback), within which you can execute queries.

[TIP]
By default, the HTTP API uses the port 7474 for HTTP and the port 7473 for HTTPS.

The overall flow is illustrated below, with each box representing a separate HTTP request:
