THIS NEEDS SOME MORE CARE

The Neo4j transactional HTTP endpoint allows you to execute a series of Cypher statements within the scope of a transaction.
The transaction may be kept open across multiple HTTP requests, until the client chooses to commit or roll back.
Each HTTP request can include a list of statements, and for convenience you can include statements along with a request to begin or commit a transaction.

The overall flow is illustrated below, with each box representing a separate HTTP request:
