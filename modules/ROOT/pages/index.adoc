The Neo4j HTTP API allows you to execute a series of Cypher statements against a Neo4j server through HTTP requests.

This guide assumes that you have:

- a running Neo4j instance -- if not, check out how to link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/[install Neo4j]
- some familiarity with <<Cypher>> -- if you need a hand, check out link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/getting-started/cypher-intro/[Getting started -> Cypher].

To execute queries through the HTTP API, you may use either:

- xref:query.adoc[Implicit transactions] -- you just submit queries, the API takes care of the transaction handling for you
- xref:transactions.adoc[Explicit transactions] -- you control the lifecycle of the transaction (open, commit, rollback), within which you can execute queries.

[TIP]
By default, the HTTP API uses port 7474 for HTTP and port 7473 for HTTPS.

The overall flow is illustrated below, with each box representing a separate HTTP request:
